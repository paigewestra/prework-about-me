      <p>When it comes to our collective psychology, technology is a huge influence in daily lives. It subconsciously sways us, it connects us, it reinforces and breaks habits... I want tech to be a good actor in this world, and we must continue to diversify those powerful minds creating more equitable systems.</p>
